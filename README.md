### What I learned

Working on this project, I applied my knowledge of **HTML, CSS, and responsive design** to build a well-structured and user-friendly contact form. Some key takeaways include:
- Implementing **CSS Grid** for layout structuring.
- Using **custom properties (CSS variables)** for better styling consistency.
- Handling **form styling** effectively.
- Adding **hover and focus states** for a better user experience.
- Debugging layout issues related to **alignment and spacing** in different screen sizes.

### Useful resources
